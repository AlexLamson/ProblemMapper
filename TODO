Practical

* Create mock-ups in mypaint

change how problems are added to allow squeezing problems in between other problems

* spacing
   * all problems are spaced equally along line, and clicking in-between them creates a new problem-solution box, nudging all other problems to the sides
   * there is a fixed about of space between problems
* nesting
   * each ProblemLine should have its own cam
   * each Problem should contain 1 ProblemLine

Conceptual

* Changing criteria for a goal (this would entail changing essential problems to nonessential problems/removing essential problems)
* Problem box with number on bottom right side linking to problem/solution that caused the problem?
* Signify that a problem has sub-problems
* problems have "due dates"
* prioritizing problems
* problem can be completed (removed?)
