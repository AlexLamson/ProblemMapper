Practical

* Nesting
   * it should be possible to reliably render multiple ProblemLines

Conceptual

* Changing criteria for a goal (this would entail changing essential problems to nonessential problems/removing essential problems)
* Problem box with number on bottom right side linking to problem/solution that caused the problem?
* Signify that a problem has sub-problems
* Due dates
* Prioritization
* Problem can be completed (fade problem to gray)
