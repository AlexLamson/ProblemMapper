Practical

* Add mock-ups to repo
* Include a screenshot every time a commit is made
* change how problems are added to allow squeezing problems in between other problems

* Spacing
   * all problems are spaced equally along line, and clicking in-between them creates a new problem-solution box, nudging all other problems to the sides
   * there is a fixed about of space between problems
* Nesting
   * each ProblemLine should have its own cam
      * it should be possible to reliably render multiple ProblemLines
   * each Problem should contain 1 ProblemLine

Conceptual

* Changing criteria for a goal (this would entail changing essential problems to nonessential problems/removing essential problems)
* Problem box with number on bottom right side linking to problem/solution that caused the problem?
* Signify that a problem has sub-problems
* Due dates
* Prioritization
* Problem can be completed (fade problem to gray)
