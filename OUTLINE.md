General

* Flow from current state to desired outcome
* Flow passes through gates
   * "no solution" = doesn't flow
   * Any other solution = does flow
* Each problem & solution has an ID (a problem & a solution will never have the same ID)
* For a solution that solves multiple problems show same solution above each problem, and with same ID
* A problem can be unsolved, partially solved, or completely solved
* A problem is either essential or nonessential
   * All problems are on 1 line, with the essential problems on the left, and nonessential problems on the right
   * Solution defaults
     * Essential problems default to "no solution"
     * Nonessential problems default to the "ignore problem" solution
* Each problem may have sub-problems running inside it, visualized by another now -> desired outcome setup


Visualization

* Boxes
   * ID is at top right of box
   * Solution box has number on left indicating total  of solutions available for that problem
* Lines
   * Line right of "ignore solution" is gray
   * Line right of "no solution" is light gray
   * All other lines are black
* In bottom left of problem, unsolved = empty circle, partially solved = half circle, completely solved = full circle
