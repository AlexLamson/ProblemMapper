Notes:
-no need to explain the current situation, because is it essentially explained in the problem
-a cause of a problem is just a sub-problem (in other words, causes=problems)
-there should be a "why is this a problem?" section thingy for the main problem (and make it scale so it can go all the way back to the true root of the matter)
