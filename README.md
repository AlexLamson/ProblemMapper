ProblemMapper
=============

A system to display problems graphically.  
Problems and solutions are represented as boxes, which can be infinitely nested.  
This allows problems to consist of a set of sub problems.  
Also, some sub-problems need be completed to solve the problem, while some don't.  
Solving all the required sub-problems represents doing the minimum, while also doing the nonessential represents anything above the minimum.
