ProblemMapper
=============

A system to display problems graphically.  
Problems and solutions are represented as boxes, which can be infinitely nested.  
This allows problems to consist of a set of sub problems.  
Also, some sub-problems need be completed to solve the problem, while some don't.  
Solving all the required sub-problems represents doing the minimum, while also doing the nonessential represents anything above the minimum.

Controls
========

* Right clicking above or below the problem boxes y values = zoom out 1 level
* Right clicking on a problem box = zoom in 1 level
* Left clicking on a problem box = change text in box
